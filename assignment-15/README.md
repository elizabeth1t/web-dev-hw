Assignment 13: (I apologize I forgot to do this for last week)
My goal for my website is to make a fun, interesting, and to make the viewer enjoy Shel's work. People would want to view this site to learn about Shel's work, why they should buy one of his books, and to appreciate his life's work.
Responsive web design is important so people can view your website on different devices and with different sizes.

Assignment 14:
My user testing sessions went well. I got good feedback that I can use to make my site more exciting, interactive, and enjoyable.
The changes I made to my website based on the user feedback I received included background color, more focus on important information, and simplification of things. I still need to add more interactive elements that the website viewer can enjoy.

Optional: Some challenges I faced this week include formating issues. Some aspects of my website I could not figure out why things were sized a certain way or I could not figure out how to adjust things.
I overcome them through research, going back through my work, and patience.

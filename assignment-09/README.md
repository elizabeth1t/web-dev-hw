My experience learning HTML was super exciting! Everything I learned was new and was such a great tool to learn. I found myself frustrated many times but still enjoyed the experience.
I am excited to learn about CSS and learn more about styling. There are many "high-tech" websites that have moving text boxes or menu bars that pop out which I am excited to learn how to create!

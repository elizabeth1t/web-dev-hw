What is a directory, and what is the relationship to files? A directory is a folder with directions to files and information. A directory is the place where a file is kept orginized and sorted.
How are VCS useful? They are useful to create shortcuts and create paths to allow one to select their file faster and easier.
Do you have a favorite artistic medium? Why is it your favorite? My favorite artistic medium is digital art through photshop. The art of combining origional art with photographs and already synthesises artwork. This creates so much origionality and creative art.
